Dynamic typing

JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language. That means you don't have to declare the type of a variable ahead of time.

---------------------------------------------

DataTypes in Javascript

The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

Six data types that are primitives:
Boolean
Null
Undefined
Number
String
Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6)
and Object

------------------------------------------------

Primitive values
All types except objects define immutable values (values, which are incapable of being changed). For example and unlike to C, Strings are immutable. We refer to values of these types as "primitive values".

------------------------------------------------

what are function and array in javascript then

By contrast, there are a few special object sub-types, which we can refer to as complex primitives.

function is a sub-type of object (technically, a "callable object"). Functions in JS are said to be "first class" in that they are basically just normal objects (with callable behavior semantics bolted on), and so they can be handled like any other plain object.

Arrays are also a form of objects, with extra behavior. The organization of contents in arrays is slightly more structured than for general objects.

Built-in Objects

There are several other object sub-types, usually referred to as built-in objects. For some of them, their names seem to imply they are directly related to their simple primitives counter-parts, but in fact, their relationship is more complicated, which we'll explore shortly.

String
Number
Boolean
Object
Function
Array
Date
RegExp
Error

------------------------------------------------

Objects - part 1

var person = {}; // empty object

var person = {
  name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
  age: 32,
  gender: 'male',
  interests: ['music', 'skiing'],
  bio: function() {
    alert(this.name[0] + ' ' + this.name[1] + ' is ' + this.age + ' years old. He likes ' + this.interests[0] + ' and ' + this.interests[1] + '.');
  },
  greeting: function() {
    alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name[0] + '.');
  }
};

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality

In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages, and act as handy data containers.

------------------------------------------------------------

the this keyword

why this keyword

Let's try to illustrate the motivation and utility of this:

function identify() {
  return this.name.toUpperCase();
}

function speak() {
  var greeting = "Hello, I'm " + identify.call( this );
  console.log( greeting );
}

var me = {
  name: "Kyle"
};

var you = {
  name: "Reader"
};

identify.call( me ); // KYLE
identify.call( you ); // READER

speak.call( me ); // Hello, I'm KYLE
speak.call( you ); // Hello, I'm READER
If the how of this snippet confuses you, don't worry! We'll get to that shortly. Just set those questions aside briefly so we can look into the why more clearly.

This code snippet allows the identify() and speak() functions to be re-used against multiple context (me and you) objects, rather than needing a separate version of the function for each object.

Instead of relying on this, you could have explicitly passed in a context object to both identify() and speak().

function identify(context) {
  return context.name.toUpperCase();
}

function speak(context) {
  var greeting = "Hello, I'm " + identify( context );
  console.log( greeting );
}

identify( you ); // READER
speak( me ); // Hello, I'm KYLE
However, the this mechanism provides a more elegant way of implicitly "passing along" an object reference, leading to cleaner API design and easier re-use.

The more complex your usage pattern is, the more clearly you'll see that passing context around as an explicit parameter is often messier than passing around a this context.


misconceptions about this keyword

1) it refers to the function itself.

The first common temptation is to assume this refers to the function itself.
Consider the following code, where we attempt to track how many times a function (foo) was called:

function foo(num) {
  console.log( "foo: " + num );

  // keep track of how many times `foo` is called
  this.count++;
}

foo.count = 0;

var i;

for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
  if (i > 5) {
    foo( i );
  }
}
// foo: 6
// foo: 7
// foo: 8
// foo: 9

// how many times was `foo` called?
console.log( foo.count ); // 0 -- WTF?
foo.count is still 0, even though the four console.log statements clearly indicate foo(..) was in fact called four times.

When the code executes foo.count = 0, indeed it's adding a property count to the function object foo. But for the this.count reference inside of the function, this is not in fact pointing at all to that function object, and so even though the property names are the same, the root objects are different, and confusion ensues.

------ avoid anonymous functions ---------
To reference a function object from inside itself, this by itself will typically be insufficient. You generally need a reference to the function object via a lexical identifier (variable) that points at it.

Consider these two functions:

function foo() {
  foo.count = 4; // `foo` refers to itself
}

setTimeout( function(){
  // anonymous function (no name), cannot
  // refer to itself
}, 10 );

In the first function, called a "named function", foo is a reference that can be used to refer to the function from inside itself.

But in the second example, the function callback passed to setTimeout(..) has no name identifier (so called an "anonymous function"), so there's no proper way to refer to the function object itself.

Note: The old-school but now deprecated and frowned-upon arguments.callee reference inside a function also points to the function object of the currently executing function. This reference is typically the only way to access an anonymous function's object from inside itself. The best approach, however, is to avoid the use of anonymous functions altogether, at least for those which require a self-reference, and instead use a named function (expression). arguments.callee is deprecated and should not be used.
----- end of avoid anonymous functions ------

So another solution to our running example would have been to use the foo identifier as a function object reference in each place, and not use this at all, which works:

function foo(num) {
  console.log( "foo: " + num );

  // keep track of how many times `foo` is called
  foo.count++;
}

foo.count = 0;

var i;

for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
  if (i > 5) {
    foo( i );
  }
}
// foo: 6
// foo: 7
// foo: 8
// foo: 9

// how many times was `foo` called?
console.log( foo.count ); // 4
However, that approach similarly side-steps actual understanding of this and relies entirely on the lexical scoping of variable foo

2) its refers to the scope

quiz - will the function bar get called ???

function foo() {
  var a = 2;
  this.bar();
}

function bar() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

foo(); //undefined

what is this keyword and how it works

this is not an author-time binding but a runtime binding. It is contextual based on the conditions of the function's invocation. this binding has nothing to do with where a function is declared, but has instead everything to do with the manner in which the function is called.

When a function is invoked, an activation record, otherwise known as an execution context, is created. This record contains information about where the function was called from (the call-stack), how the function was invoked, what parameters were passed, etc. One of the properties of this record is the this reference which will be used for the duration of that function's execution.

Call-site

To understand this binding, we have to understand the call-site: the location in code where a function is called (not where it's declared). We must inspect the call-site to answer the question: what's this this a reference to?

The call-site we care about is in the invocation before the currently executing function.
Let's demonstrate call-stack and call-site:

function baz() {
    // call-stack is: `baz`
    // so, our call-site is in the global scope

    console.log( "baz" );
    bar(); // <-- call-site for `bar`
}

function bar() {
    // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar`
    // so, our call-site is in `baz`

    console.log( "bar" );
    foo(); // <-- call-site for `foo`
}

function foo() {
    // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar` -> `foo`
    // so, our call-site is in `bar`

    console.log( "foo" );
}

baz(); // <-- call-site for `baz`
Take care when analyzing code to find the actual call-site (from the call-stack), because it's the only thing that matters for this binding.

Nothing But Rules

We turn our attention now to how the call-site determines where this will point during the execution of a function.

You must inspect the call-site and determine which of 4 rules applies. We will first explain each of these 4 rules independently, and then we will illustrate their order of precedence, if multiple rules could apply to the call-site.

Default Binding

The first rule we will examine comes from the most common case of function calls: standalone function invocation. Think of this this rule as the default catch-all rule when none of the other rules apply.

Consider this code:

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo(); // 2

 we see that when foo() is called, this.a resolves to our global variable a. Why? Because in this case, the default binding for this applies to the function call, and so points this at the global object.

How do we know that the default binding rule applies here? We examine the call-site to see how foo() is called. In our snippet, foo() is called with a plain, un-decorated function reference. None of the other rules we will demonstrate will apply here, so the default binding applies instead.

If strict mode is in effect, the global object is not eligible for the default binding, so the this is instead set to undefined.

function foo() {
  "use strict";

  console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo(); // TypeError: `this` is `undefined`

Implicit Binding

Another rule to consider is: does the call-site have a context object, also referred to as an owning or containing object, 

Consider:

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
  a: 2,
  foo: foo
};

obj.foo(); // 2

Firstly, notice the manner in which foo() is declared and then later added as a reference property onto obj. Regardless of whether foo() is initially declared on obj, or is added as a reference later (as this snippet shows), in neither case is the function really "owned" or "contained" by the obj object.

However, the call-site uses the obj context to reference the function, so you could say that the obj object "owns" or "contains" the function reference at the time the function is called.

Whatever you choose to call this pattern, at the point that foo() is called, it's preceded by an object reference to obj. When there is a context object for a function reference, the implicit binding rule says that it's that object which should be used for the function call's this binding.

Because obj is the this for the foo() call, this.a is synonymous with obj.a.

Only the top/last level of an object property reference chain matters to the call-site. For instance:

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var obj2 = {
  a: 42,
  foo: foo
};

var obj1 = {
  a: 2,
  obj2: obj2
};

obj1.obj2.foo(); // 42

Implicitly Lost

One of the most common frustrations that this binding creates is when an implicitly bound function loses that binding, which usually means it falls back to the default binding, of either the global object or undefined, depending on strict mode.

Consider:

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
  a: 2,
  foo: foo
};

var bar = obj.foo; // function reference/alias!

var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

bar(); // "oops, global"
Even though bar appears to be a reference to obj.foo, in fact, it's really just another reference to foo itself. Moreover, the call-site is what matters, and the call-site is bar(), which is a plain, un-decorated call and thus the default binding applies.

The more subtle, more common, and more unexpected way this occurs is when we consider passing a callback function:

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

function doFoo(fn) {
  // `fn` is just another reference to `foo`

  fn(); // <-- call-site!
}

var obj = {
  a: 2,
  foo: foo
};

var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

doFoo( obj.foo ); // "oops, global"

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
  a: 2,
  foo: foo
};

var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

setTimeout( obj.foo, 100 ); // "

Explicit Binding

 what if you want to force a function call to use a particular object for the this binding, without putting a property function reference on the object?

 "All" functions in the language have some utilities available to them which can be useful for this task. Specifically, functions have call(..) and apply(..) methods. The vast majority of functions provided, and certainly all functions you will create, do have access to call(..) and apply(..).

How do these utilities work? They both take, as their first parameter, an object to use for the this, and then invoke the function with that this specified. Since you are directly stating what you want the this to be, we call it explicit binding.

Consider:

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
  a: 2
};

foo.call( obj ); // 2

Invoking foo with explicit binding by foo.call(..) allows us to force its this to be obj.
----- boxing start -----
If you pass a simple primitive value (of type string, boolean, or number) as the this binding, the primitive value is wrapped in its object-form (new String(..), new Boolean(..), or new Number(..), respectively). This is often referred to as "boxing".
----- boxing end -----
Unfortunately, explicit binding alone still doesn't offer any solution to the issue mentioned previously, of a function "losing" its intended this binding, or just having it paved over by a framework, etc.

Hard Binding

But a variation pattern around explicit binding actually does the trick. Consider:

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
  a: 2
};

var bar = function() {
  foo.call( obj );
};

bar(); // 2
setTimeout( bar, 100 ); // 2

// `bar` hard binds `foo`'s `this` to `obj`
// so that it cannot be overriden
bar.call( window ); // 2
Let's examine how this variation works. We create a function bar() which, internally, manually calls foo.call(obj), thereby forcibly invoking foo with obj binding for this. No matter how you later invoke the function bar, it will always manually invoke foo with obj. This binding is both explicit and strong, so we call it hard binding.


The most typical way to wrap a function with a hard binding creates a pass-thru of any arguments passed and any return value received:

function foo(something) {
  console.log( this.a, something );
  return this.a + something;
}

var obj = {
  a: 2
};

var bar = function() {
  return foo.apply( obj, arguments );
};

var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
console.log( b ); // 5

Another way to express this pattern is to create a re-usable helper:

function foo(something) {
  console.log( this.a, something );
  return this.a + something;
}

// simple `bind` helper
function bind(fn, obj) {
  return function() {
    return fn.apply( obj, arguments );
  };
}

var obj = {
  a: 2
};

var bar = bind( foo, obj );

var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
console.log( b ); // 5

Since hard binding is such a common pattern, it's provided with a built-in utility as of ES5: Function.prototype.bind, and it's used like this:

function foo(something) {
  console.log( this.a, something );
  return this.a + something;
}

var obj = {
  a: 2
};

var bar = foo.bind( obj );

var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
console.log( b ); // 5
bind(..) returns a new function that is hard-coded to call the original function with the this context set as you specified.

new binding ( new keyword )

what are constructors in javascript ( new keyword )

 In JS, constructors are just functions that happen to be called with the new operator in front of them. They are not attached to classes, nor are they instantiating a class. They are not even special types of functions. They're just regular functions that are, in essence, hijacked by the use of new in their invocation.

 This is an important but subtle distinction: there's really no such thing as "constructor functions", but rather construction calls of functions.

 When a function is invoked with new in front of it, otherwise known as a constructor call, the following things are done automatically:

1)a brand new object is created (aka, constructed) out of thin air
2)the newly constructed object is [[Prototype]]-linked
3)the newly constructed object is set as the this binding for that function call
4)unless the function returns its own alternate object, the new-invoked function call will automatically return the newly constructed object.

Consider this code:

function foo(a) {
  this.a = a;
}

var bar = new foo( 2 );
console.log( bar.a ); // 2
By calling foo(..) with new in front of it, we've constructed a new object and set that new object as the this for the call of foo(..). So new is the final way that a function call's this can be bound. We'll call this new binding.


rule precedence :

So, now we've uncovered the 4 rules for binding this in function calls. All you need to do is find the call-site and inspect it to see which rule applies. But, what if the call-site has multiple eligible rules? There must be an order of precedence to these rules

It should be clear that the default binding is the lowest priority rule of the 4. So we'll just set that one aside.

Which is more precedent, implicit binding or explicit binding? Let's test it:

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var obj1 = {
  a: 2,
  foo: foo
};

var obj2 = {
  a: 3,
  foo: foo
};

obj1.foo(); // 2
obj2.foo(); // 3

obj1.foo.call( obj2 ); // 3
obj2.foo.call( obj1 ); // 2
So, explicit binding takes precedence over implicit binding, which means you should ask first if explicit binding applies before checking for implicit binding.

Note: new and call/apply cannot be used together, so new foo.call(obj1) is not allowed, to test new binding directly against explicit binding. But we can still use a hard binding to test the precedence of the two rules.

Before we explore that in a code listing, think back to how hard binding physically works, which is that Function.prototype.bind(..) creates a new wrapper function that is hard-coded to ignore its own this binding (whatever it may be), and use a manual one we provide.

By that reasoning, it would seem obvious to assume that hard binding (which is a form of explicit binding) is more precedent than new binding, and thus cannot be overridden with new.

Let's check:

function foo(something) {
  this.a = something;
}

var obj1 = {};

var bar = foo.bind( obj1 );
bar( 2 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2

var baz = new bar( 3 );
console.log( obj1.a ); // 2
console.log( baz.a ); // 3
Whoa! bar is hard-bound against obj1, but new bar(3) did not change obj1.a to be 3 as we would have expected. Instead, the hard bound (to obj1) call to bar(..) is able to be overridden with new.
Since new was applied, we got the newly created object back, which we named baz, and we see in fact that baz.a has the value 3.
This should be surprising if you go back to our "fake" bind helper:

function bind(fn, obj) {
  return function() {
    fn.apply( obj, arguments );
  };
}
If you reason about how the helper's code works, it does not have a way for a new operator call to override the hard-binding to obj as we just observed.

Determining this

Now, we can summarize the rules for determining this from a function call's call-site, in their order of precedence. Ask these questions in this order, and stop when the first rule applies.

Is the function called with new (new binding)? If so, this is the newly constructed object.

var bar = new foo()

Is the function called with call or apply (explicit binding), even hidden inside a bind hard binding? If so, this is the explicitly specified object.

var bar = foo.call( obj2 )

Is the function called with a context (implicit binding), otherwise known as an owning or containing object? If so, this is that context object.

var bar = obj1.foo()

Otherwise, default the this (default binding). If in strict mode, pick undefined, otherwise pick the global object.

var bar = foo()

That's it. That's all it takes to understand the rules of this binding for normal function calls. Well... almost.

Ignored this

If you pass null or undefined as a this binding parameter to call, apply, or bind, those values are effectively ignored, and instead the default binding rule applies to the invocation.

function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo.call( null ); // 2

Why would you intentionally pass something like null for a this binding?

It's quite common to use apply(..) for spreading out arrays of values as parameters to a function call. Similarly, bind(..) can curry parameters (pre-set values), which can be very helpful.

function foo(a,b) {
  console.log( "a:" + a + ", b:" + b );
}

// spreading out array as parameters
foo.apply( null, [2, 3] ); // a:2, b:3

// currying with `bind(..)`
var bar = foo.bind( null, 2 );
bar( 3 ); // a:2, b:3

-----------------------------------------------------------

objects part 2

[[Prototype]]

Objects in JavaScript have an internal property, denoted in the specification as [[Prototype]], which is simply a reference to another object. Almost all objects are given a non-null value for this property, at the time of their creation.

Consider:

var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

myObject.a; // 2

 the [[Get]] operation that is invoked when you reference a property on an object, such as myObject.a. For that default [[Get]] operation, the first step is to check if the object itself has a property a on it, and if so, it's used.

 But it's what happens if a isn't present on myObject that brings our attention now to the [[Prototype]] link of the object.

The default [[Get]] operation proceeds to follow the [[Prototype]] link of the object if it cannot find the requested property on the object directly.

var anotherObject = {
  a: 2
};

// create an object linked to `anotherObject`
var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

myObject.a; // 2

So, we have myObject that is now [[Prototype]] linked to anotherObject. Clearly myObject.a doesn't actually exist, but nevertheless, the property access succeeds (being found on anotherObject instead) and indeed finds the value 2.

But, if a weren't found on anotherObject either, its [[Prototype]] chain, if non-empty, is again consulted and followed.

This process continues until either a matching property name is found, or the [[Prototype]] chain ends. If no matching property is ever found by the end of the chain, the return result from the [[Get]] operation is undefined

So, the [[Prototype]] chain is consulted, one link at a time, when you perform property look-ups in various fashions. The look-up stops once the property is found or the chain ends.

Object.prototype

The top-end of every normal [[Prototype]] chain is the built-in Object.prototype. This object includes a variety of common utilities used all over JS, because all normal (built-in, not host-specific extension) objects in JavaScript "descend from" (aka, have at the top of their [[Prototype]] chain) the Object.prototype object.
Some utilities found here you may be familiar with include .toString() and .valueOf().

myObject.foo = "bar";

If foo is not already present directly on myObject, the [[Prototype]] chain is traversed, just like for the [[Get]] operation. If foo is not found anywhere in the chain, the property foo is added directly to myObject with the specified value, as expected.

However, if foo is already present somewhere higher in the chain, nuanced (and perhaps surprising) behavior can occur with the myObject.foo = "bar" assignment.

If the property name foo ends up both on myObject itself and at a higher level of the [[Prototype]] chain that starts at myObject, this is called shadowing. The foo property directly on myObject shadows any foo property which appears higher in the chain, because the myObject.foo look-up would always find the foo property that's lowest in the chain.

"Class"

in JavaScript, there are no abstract patterns/blueprints for objects called "classes" as there are in class-oriented languages. JavaScript just has objects.

In fact, JavaScript is almost unique among languages as perhaps the only language with the right to use the label "object oriented", because it's one of a very short list of languages where an object can be created directly, without a class at all.

In JavaScript, classes can't (being that they don't exist!) describe what an object can do. The object defines its own behavior directly. There's just the object.

"Class" Functions

The peculiar "sort-of class" behavior hinges on a strange characteristic of functions: all functions by default get a public property on them called prototype, which points at an otherwise arbitrary object.

function Foo() {
  // ...
}

Foo.prototype; 

This object is often called "Foo's prototype", because we access it via an unfortunately-named Foo.prototype property reference.

Whatever we call it, what exactly is this object?

The most direct way to explain it is that each object created from calling new Foo() (see Chapter 2) will end up (somewhat arbitrarily) [[Prototype]]-linked to this "Foo dot prototype" object.

Let's illustrate:

function Foo() {
  // ...
}

var a = new Foo();

Object.getPrototypeOf( a ) === Foo.prototype; // true
When a is created by calling new Foo(), one of the things (see Chapter 2 for all four steps) that happens is that a gets an internal [[Prototype]] link to the object that Foo.prototype is pointing at.

In class-oriented languages, multiple copies (aka, "instances") of a class can be made, like stamping something out from a mold. As we saw in Chapter 4, this happens because the process of instantiating (or inheriting from) a class means, "copy the behavior plan from that class into a physical object", and this is done again for each new instance.

But in JavaScript, there are no such copy-actions performed. You don't create multiple instances of a class. You can create multiple objects that [[Prototype]] link to a common object. But by default, no copying occurs, and thus these objects don't end up totally separate and disconnected from each other, but rather, quite linked.

new Foo() results in a new object (we called it a), and that new object a is internally [[Prototype]] linked to the Foo.prototype object.

We end up with two objects, linked to each other. That's it.

"Constructors"

Let's go back to some earlier code:

function Foo() {
  // ...
}

var a = new Foo();

The Foo.prototype object by default (at declaration time on line 1 of the snippet!) gets a public, non-enumerable (see Chapter 3) property called .constructor, and this property is a reference back to the function (Foo in this case) that the object is associated with. Moreover, we see that object a created by the "constructor" call new Foo() seems to also have a property on it called .constructor which similarly points to "the function which created it".

Constructor Or Call?

In the above snippet, it's tempting to think that Foo is a "constructor", because we call it with new and we observe that it "constructs" an object.

In reality, Foo is no more a "constructor" than any other function in your program. Functions themselves are not constructors. However, when you put the new keyword in front of a normal function call, that makes that function call a "constructor call". In fact, new sort of hijacks any normal function and calls it in a fashion that constructs an object, in addition to whatever else it was going to do.

For example:

function NothingSpecial() {
  console.log( "Don't mind me!" );
}

var a = new NothingSpecial();
// "Don't mind me!"

a; // {}

NothingSpecial is just a plain old normal function, but when called with new, it constructs an object, almost as a side-effect, which we happen to assign to a. The call was a constructor call, but NothingSpecial is not, in and of itself, a constructor.

In other words, in JavaScript, it's most appropriate to say that a "constructor" is any function called with the new keyword in front of it.

Functions aren't constructors, but function calls are "constructor calls" if and only if new is used.

function Foo(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Foo.prototype.myName = function() {
  return this.name;
};

var a = new Foo( "a" );
var b = new Foo( "b" );

a.myName(); // "a"
b.myName(); // "b"

In the above snippet, it's strongly tempting to think that when a and b are created, the properties/functions on the Foo.prototype object are copied over to each of a and b objects. However, that's not what happens.

At the beginning of this chapter, we explained the [[Prototype]] link, and how it provides the fall-back look-up steps if a property reference isn't found directly on an object, as part of the default [[Get]] algorithm.

So, by virtue of how they are created, a and b each end up with an internal [[Prototype]] linkage to Foo.prototype. When myName is not found on a or b, respectively, it's instead found (through delegation, see Chapter 6) on Foo.prototype.

"Constructor" Redux

Recall the discussion from earlier about the .constructor property, and how it seems like a.constructor === Foo being true means that a has an actual .constructor property on it, pointing at Foo? Not correct.

This is just unfortunate confusion. In actuality, the .constructor reference is also delegated up to Foo.prototype, which happens to, by default, have a .constructor that points at Foo.

 the .constructor property on Foo.prototype is only there by default on the object created when Foo the function is declared. If you create a new object, and replace a function's default .prototype object reference, the new object will not by default magically get a .constructor on it.

 Consider:

function Foo() { /* .. */ }

Foo.prototype = { /* .. */ }; // create a new prototype object

var a1 = new Foo();
a1.constructor === Foo; // false!
a1.constructor === Object; // true!

a1 has no .constructor property, so it delegates up the [[Prototype]] chain to Foo.prototype. But that object doesn't have a .constructor either (like the default Foo.prototype object would have had!), so it keeps delegating, this time up to Object.prototype, the top of the delegation chain. That object indeed has a .constructor on it, which points to the built-in Object(..) function.

"(Prototypal) Inheritance"

function Foo(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Foo.prototype.myName = function() {
  return this.name;
};

function Bar(name,label) {
  Foo.call( this, name );
  this.label = label;
}

// here, we make a new `Bar.prototype`
// linked to `Foo.prototype`
Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype );

// Beware! Now `Bar.prototype.constructor` is gone,
// and might need to be manually "fixed" if you're
// in the habit of relying on such properties!

Bar.prototype.myLabel = function() {
  return this.label;
};

var a = new Bar( "a", "obj a" );

a.myName(); // "a"
a.myLabel(); // "obj a"

The important part is Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype ). Object.create(..) creates a "new" object out of thin air, and links that new object's internal [[Prototype]] to the object you specify (Foo.prototype in this case).

In other words, that line says: "make a new 'Bar dot prototype' object that's linked to 'Foo dot prototype'."

Note: A common mis-conception/confusion here is that either of the following approaches would also work, but they do not work as you'd expect:

// doesn't work like you want!
Bar.prototype = Foo.prototype;

// works kinda like you want, but with
// side-effects you probably don't want :(
Bar.prototype = new Foo();
Bar.prototype = Foo.prototype doesn't create a new object for Bar.prototype to be linked to. It just makes Bar.prototype be another reference to Foo.prototype, which effectively links Bar directly to the same object as Foo links to: Foo.prototype. This means when you start assigning, like Bar.prototype.myLabel = ..., you're modifying not a separate object but the shared Foo.prototype object itself, which would affect any objects linked to Foo.prototype. This is almost certainly not what you want. If it is what you want, then you likely don't need Bar at all, and should just use only Foo and make your code simpler.

Bar.prototype = new Foo() does in fact create a new object which is duly linked to Foo.prototype as we'd want. But, it uses the Foo(..) "constructor call" to do it. If that function has any side-effects (such as logging, changing state, registering against other objects, adding data properties to this, etc.), those side-effects happen at the time of this linking (and likely against the wrong object!), rather than only when the eventual Bar() "descendants" are created, as would likely be expected.

So, we're left with using Object.create(..) to make a new object that's properly linked, but without having the side-effects of calling Foo(..). The slight downside is that we have to create a new object, throwing the old one away, instead of modifying the existing default object we're provided.

Inspecting "Class" Relationships

What if you have an object like a and want to find out what object (if any) it delegates to? Inspecting an instance (just an object in JS) for its inheritance ancestry (delegation linkage in JS) is often called introspection (or reflection) in traditional class-oriented environments.

Consider:

function Foo() {
  // ...
}

Foo.prototype.blah = ...;

var a = new Foo();
How do we then introspect a to find out its "ancestry" (delegation linkage)? The first approach embraces the "class" confusion:

a instanceof Foo; // true
The instanceof operator takes a plain object as its left-hand operand and a function as its right-hand operand. The question instanceof answers is: in the entire [[Prototype]] chain of a, does the object arbitrarily pointed to by Foo.prototype ever appear?

Unfortunately, this means that you can only inquire about the "ancestry" of some object (a) if you have some function (Foo, with its attached .prototype reference) to test with. If you have two arbitrary objects, say a and b, and want to find out if the objects are related to each other through a [[Prototype]] chain, instanceof alone can't help.

// helper utility to see if `o1` is
// related to (delegates to) `o2`
function isRelatedTo(o1, o2) {
  function F(){}
  F.prototype = o2;
  return o1 instanceof F;
}

var a = {};
var b = Object.create( a );

isRelatedTo( b, a ); // true
Inside isRelatedTo(..), we borrow a throw-away function F, reassign its .prototype to arbitrarily point to some object o2, then ask if o1 is an "instance of" F. Obviously o1 isn't actually inherited or descended or even constructed from F, so it should be clear why this kind of exercise is silly and confusing. The problem comes down to the awkwardness of class semantics forced upon JavaScript, in this case as revealed by the indirect semantics of instanceof.

The second, and much cleaner, approach to [[Prototype]] reflection is:

Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf( a ); // true

We just need two objects to inspect a relationship between them. For example:

// Simply: does `b` appear anywhere in
// `c`s [[Prototype]] chain?
b.isPrototypeOf( c );
Notice, this approach doesn't require a function ("class") at all. It just uses object references directly to b and c, and inquires about their relationship. In other words, our isRelatedTo(..) utility above is built-in to the language, and it's called isPrototypeOf(..).

We can also directly retrieve the [[Prototype]] of an object. As of ES5, the standard way to do this is:

Object.getPrototypeOf( a );
And you'll notice that object reference is what we'd expect:

Object.getPrototypeOf( a ) === Foo.prototype; // true

Most browsers (not all!) have also long supported a non-standard alternate way of accessing the internal [[Prototype]]:

a.__proto__ === Foo.prototype; // true

The strange .__proto__ (not standardized until ES6!) property "magically" retrieves the internal [[Prototype]] of an object as a reference, which is quite helpful if you want to directly inspect (or even traverse: .__proto__.__proto__...) the chain.

Just as we saw earlier with .constructor, .__proto__ doesn't actually exist on the object you're inspecting (a in our running example). In fact, it exists (non-enumerable; see Chapter 2) on the built-in Object.prototype, along with the other common utilities (.toString(), .isPrototypeOf(..), etc).

Object Links

As we've now seen, the [[Prototype]] mechanism is an internal link that exists on one object which references some other object.

This linkage is (primarily) exercised when a property/method reference is made against the first object, and no such property/method exists. In that case, the [[Prototype]] linkage tells the engine to look for the property/method on the linked-to object. In turn, if that object cannot fulfill the look-up, its [[Prototype]] is followed, and so on. This series of links between objects forms what is called the "prototype chain".

var foo = {
  something: function() {
    console.log( "Tell me something good..." );
  }
};

var bar = Object.create( foo );
  
bar.something(); // Tell me something good...

Object.create(..) creates a new object (bar) linked to the object we specified (foo), which gives us all the power (delegation) of the [[Prototype]] mechanism, but without any of the unnecessary complication of new functions acting as classes and constructor calls, confusing .prototype and .constructor references, or any of that extra stuff.

Note: Object.create(null) creates an object that has an empty (aka, null) [[Prototype]] linkage, and thus the object can't delegate anywhere. Since such an object has no prototype chain, the instanceof operator (explained earlier) has nothing to check, so it will always return false. These special empty-[[Prototype]] objects are often called "dictionaries" as they are typically used purely for storing data in properties, mostly because they have no possible surprise effects from any delegated properties/functions on the [[Prototype]] chain, and are thus purely flat data storage.

We don't need classes to create meaningful relationships between two objects. The only thing we should really care about is objects linked together for delegation, and Object.create(..) gives us that linkage without all the class cruft.

example of prototypal inheritance and an explaination of it

function Person(first, last, age, gender, interests) {
        this.name = {
          first,
          last
        };
        this.age = age;
        this.gender = gender;
        this.interests = interests;
      };
      Person.prototype.bio = function() {
        // First define a string, and make it equal to the part of
        // the bio that we know will always be the same.
        var string = this.name.first + ' ' + this.name.last + ' is ' + this.age + ' years old. ';
        // define a variable that will contain the pronoun part of
        // the sencond sentence
        var pronoun;
        // check what the value of gender is, and set pronoun
        // to an appropriate value in each case
        if(this.gender === 'male' || this.gender === 'Male' || this.gender === 'm' || this.gender === 'M') {
          pronoun = 'He likes ';
        } else if(this.gender === 'female' || this.gender === 'Female' || this.gender === 'f' || this.gender === 'F') {
          pronoun = 'She likes ';
        } else {
          pronoun = 'They like ';
        }
        // add the pronoun string on to the end of the main string
        string += pronoun;
        // use another conditional to structure the last part of the
        // second sentence depending on whether the number of interests
        // is 1, 2, or 3
        if(this.interests.length === 1) {
          string += this.interests[0] + '.';
        } else if(this.interests.length === 2) {
          string += this.interests[0] + ' and ' + this.interests[1] + '.';
        } else {
          // if there are more than 2 interests, we loop through them
          // all, adding each one to the main string followed by a comma,
          // except for the last one, which needs an and & a full stop
          for(var i = 0; i < this.interests.length; i++) {
            if(i === this.interests.length - 1) {
              string += 'and ' + this.interests[i] + '.';
            } else {
              string += this.interests[i] + ', ';
            }
          }
        }
        // finally, with the string built, we alert() it
        alert(string);
      };
      Person.prototype.greeting = function() {
        alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name.first + '.');
      };
      Person.prototype.farewell = function() {
        alert(this.name.first + ' has left the building. Bye for now!');
      }
      var person1 = new Person('Tammi', 'Smith', 17, 'female', ['music', 'skiing', 'kickboxing']);

The prototype property: Where inherited members are defined
So, where are the inherited properties and methods defined? If you look at the Object reference page, you'll see listed in the left hand side a large number of properties and methods — many more than the number of inherited members we saw available on the person1 object in the above screenshot. Some are inherited, and some aren't — why is this?

The answer is that the inherited ones are the ones defined on the prototype property (you could call it a sub namespace) — that is, the ones that begin with Object.prototype., and not the ones that begin with just Object. The prototype property's value is an object, which is basically a bucket for storing properties and methods that we want to be inherited by objects further down the prototype chain.

So Object.prototype.watch(), Object.prototype.valueOf(), etc., are available to any object types that inherit from Object.prototype, including new object instances created from the constructor.

Object.is(), Object.keys(), and other members not defined inside the prototype bucket are not inherited by object instances or object types that inherit from Object.prototype. They are methods/properties available just on the Object() constructor itself.

This seems strange — how can you have a method defined on a constructor, which is itself a function? Well, a function is also a type of object — see the Function() constructor reference if you don't believe us.

Person.prototype.isEnumerableProperty is available because it's constructor function is "Object" whose prototype property has isEnumerableProperty

You'll see other examples of prototype chain inheritance all over JavaScript — try looking for the methods and properties defined on the prototype of the String, Date, Number, and Array global objects, for example. These all have a number of members defined on their prototype, which is why for example when you create a string, like this:

var myString = 'This is my string.';
myString immediately has a number of useful methods available on it, like split(), indexOf(), replace(), etc.

Revisiting create()
Earlier on we showed how the Object.create() method can be used to create a new object instance.

For example, try this in your previous example's JavaScript console:
var person2 = Object.create(person1);
What create() actually does is to create a new object from a specified prototype object. Here, person2 is being created using person1 as a prototype object. You can check this by entering the following in the console:
person2.__proto__
This will return the person1 object.

The constructor property
Every function has a prototype property whose value is an object containing a constructor property. 
his constructor property points to the original constructor function. As you will see in the next section that properties defined on the Person.prototype property (or in general on a constructor function's prototype property which is an object as mentioned in the above section) become available to all the instance objects created using the Person() constructor. Hence, the constructor property is also available to both person1 and person2 objects.

A clever trick is that you can put parentheses onto the end of the constructor property (containing any required parameters) to create another object instance from that constructor. The constructor is a function after all, so can be invoked using parentheses; you just need to include the new keyword to specify that you want to use the function as a constructor.

var person3 = new person1.constructor('Karen', 'Stephenson', 26, 'female', ['playing drums', 'mountain climbing']);

This works well. You won't need to use it often, but it can be really useful when you want to create a new instance and don't have a reference to the original constructor easily available for some reason.

Modifying prototypes

Person.prototype.farewell = function() {
  alert(this.name.first + ' has left the building. Bye for now!');
}

This is really useful, but what is even more useful is that the whole inheritance chain has updated dynamically, automatically making this new method available on all object instances derived from the constructor.

function Person(first, last, age, gender, interests) {

  // property and method definitions

};

var person1 = new Person('Tammi', 'Smith', 32, 'neutral', ['music', 'skiing', 'kickboxing']);

Person.prototype.farewell = function() {
  alert(this.name.first + ' has left the building. Bye for now!');
}

But the farewell() method is still available on the person1 object instance — its available functionality has been automatically updated. This proves what we said earlier about the prototype chain, and the browser looking upwards in the chain to find methods that aren't defined on the object instance itself rather than those methods being copied to the instance. This provides a very powerful, extensible system of functionality.

You will rarely see properties defined on the prototype property, because they are not very flexible when defined like this. For example you could add a property like so:

Person.prototype.fullName = 'Bob Smith';
But this isn't very flexible, as the person might not be called that. It'd be much better to do this, to build the fullName out of name.first and name.last:

Person.prototype.fullName = this.name.first + ' ' + this.name.last;
This however doesn't work, as this will be referencing the global scope in this case, not the function scope. Calling this property would return undefined undefined. This worked fine on the method we defined earlier in the prototype because it is sitting inside a function scope, which will be transferred successfully to the object instance scope. So you might define constant properties on the prototype

a fairly common pattern for more object definitions is to define the properties inside the constructor, and the methods on the prototype. This makes the code easier to read, as the constructor only contains the property definitions, and the methods are split off into separate blocks. For example:

// Constructor with property definitions

function Test(a, b, c, d) {
  // property definitions
};

// First method definition

Test.prototype.x = function() { ... }

// Second method definition

Test.prototype.y = function() { ... }

// etc.

Prototypal inheritance

How do we create an object in JavaScript that inherits from another object?

JavaScript uses a different system — "inheriting" objects do not have functionality copied over to them, instead the functionality they inherit is linked to via the prototype chain(often referred to as prototypal inheritance).

function Person(first, last, age, gender, interests) {
  this.name = {
    first,
    last
  };
  this.age = age;
  this.gender = gender;
  this.interests = interests;
};

Person.prototype.greeting = function() {
  alert('Hi! I\'m ' + this.name.first + '.');
};

Say we wanted to create a Teacher class, like the one we described in our initial object-oriented definition, which inherits all the members from Person, but also includes:

A new property, subject — this will contain the subject the teacher teaches.
An updated greeting() method, which sounds a bit more formal than the standard greeting() method — more suitable for a teacher addressing some students at school.

Defining a Teacher() constructor function
The first thing we need to do is create a Teacher() constructor — add the following below the existing code:

function Teacher(first, last, age, gender, interests, subject) {
  Person.call(this, first, last, age, gender, interests);

  this.subject = subject;
}

This looks similar to the Person constructor in many ways, but there is something strange here that we've not seen before — the call() function. This function basically allows you to call a function defined somewhere else, but in the current context.

We want the Teacher() constructor to take the same parameters as the Person() constructor it is inheriting from, so we specify them all as parameters in the call() invocation.

As a note, we could have simply done this:

function Teacher(first, last, age, gender, interests, subject) {
  this.name = {
    first,
    last
  };
  this.age = age;
  this.gender = gender;
  this.interests = interests;
  this.subject = subject;
}
But this is just redefining the properties anew, not inheriting them from Person(), so it defeats the point of what we are trying to do. It also takes more lines of code.

Setting Teacher()'s prototype and constructor reference
All is good so far, but we have a problem. We have defined a new constructor, and it has a prototype property that by default just contains a reference to the constructor function itself (try entering Teacher.prototype.constructor into your JavaScript console at this point). We need to get Teacher() to inherit the methods defined on Person()'s prototype. So how do we do that?

Add the following line below your previous addition:
Teacher.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
We need to do one more thing before we move on — after adding the last line, the Teacher() prototype's constructor property is now equal to Person(), because we just set Teacher.prototype to be equal to an object that is a copy of Person.prototype! Try saving your code, loading the page in a browser, and entering Teacher.prototype.constructor into the console again to verify.
This can become a problem, so we need to set this right — you can do so by going back to your source code and adding the following line at the bottom:
Teacher.prototype.constructor = Teacher;

Giving Teacher() a new greeting() function
To finish off our code, we need to define a new greeting() function on the Teacher() constructor.

The easiest way to do this is to define it on Teacher()'s prototype — add the following at the bottom of your code:

Teacher.prototype.greeting = function() {
  var prefix;

  if (this.gender === 'male' || this.gender === 'Male' || this.gender === 'm' || this.gender === 'M') {
    prefix = 'Mr.';
  } else if (this.gender === 'female' || this.gender === 'Female' || this.gender === 'f' || this.gender === 'F') {
    prefix = 'Mrs.';
  } else {
    prefix = 'Mx.';
  }

  alert('Hello. My name is ' + prefix + ' ' + this.name.last + ', and I teach ' + this.subject + '.');
};

Trying the example out
Now you've entered all the code, try creating an object instance from Teacher() by putting the following at the bottom of your JavaScript (or something similar of your choosing):

var teacher1 = new Teacher('Dave', 'Griffiths', 31, 'male', ['football', 'cookery'], 'mathematics');
Now save and refresh, and try accessing the properties and methods of your new teacher1 object, for example:

teacher1.name.first;
teacher1.interests[0];
teacher1.bio();
teacher1.subject;
teacher1.greeting();
